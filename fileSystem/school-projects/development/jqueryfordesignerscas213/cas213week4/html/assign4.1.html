<h2>Learning how to use a JavaScript jQuery plug-in show the power of using a library is, Let me show you in this example of using a jQuery plug-in on scrolling:</h2>

<p class="linkpath"> Scrolling to a paragraph:
    <a href="#para1">1</a>
	<a href="#para2">2</a>
	<a href="#para3">3</a>
	<a href="#para4">4</a>
	<a href="#para5">5</a>
</p>
	

<div id="scrolling">
	
	<p id="para1">In this chapter I learned how to use a jQuery library plug-in in conjunction with the base jQuery library. I have looked into some of the other plug-in the jQuery community developers publish and they are all over the web. </p>

	<p id="para2">Some of the jQuery plug-ins do a lot of things all crammed into a small package. I have been looking at the jQuery UI plug-in for a freelance gig I have and they offer many easily add features to the base jQuery library. </p>

	<p id="para3">I feel that I have just started looking at the visible top of the ice burg and as everyone knows from Titanic most of the ice burg is under the sea. Using this as a metaphor to jQuery's deep line of features and vocabulary that you can only be seen under the water.</p>

	<p id="para4">But to understand that most of the ice burg is under the sea water you must go diving. one must only dive in if they know the basics of the forces that control the ice burg and one must use concision.</p>

	<p id="para5">I'm looking forward to taking that first dive into the dark sea waters but only when I know how to swim in the ocean of jQuery.</p>
