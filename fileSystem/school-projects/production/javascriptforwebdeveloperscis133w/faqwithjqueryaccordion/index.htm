	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	
	<h2>What's your philosophy of teaching?</h2>
	<div class="answer">
		<p>Good question... Well, first &amp; foremost, I strongly believe that learning should be fun. We spend far too much of our lives in school for it to be a dull, unpleasant experience. Just as strongly, I believe that we truly should be learning when we take a class. It's a sad state of affairs when higher education becomes little more than a piece of paper. So I try to create an environment that is highly conducive to learning.</p>

		<p>Frankly, I'm not too big on grades. They're not a particularly accurate measure of how well you'll do in the real world. And they have a way of taking our focus off of what's really important - learning. But for the time being, they're here to stay, and we need to make the best of them. For my part, I'll do the best I can to be fair &amp; reasonable.</p>

		<p>Learning is a highly complex, interactive process. The days of spoon-feeding information into empty heads are over. Now we must find &amp; implement new ways to facilitate learning for everyone. We're on the right road. This is a good time in history to be a student... and a teacher.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Are you easy or hard?</h2>
	<div class="answer">
		<p>Funny you should ask. I would say that my classes are quite challenging. Because of my experience as a software engineer, and having worked with so many unqualified programmers, it is important that my students really know their stuff. Most students usually say I'm challenging, but very fair. Expect to put in many hours a week.</p>

		<p>So, you absolutely should not take one of my classes if you're looking for an easy "A". An "A" is quite realistic, but you will have to work for it, and you will learn a lot.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, I will do everything possible to help you succeed. I will frequently give you tips on how to get a good grade. And I don't believe in trick questions. My classes are interesting &amp; relevant. When you do well in my class, you can be sure you will do great on the job.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>How do I get a good grade in your class?</h2>
	<div class="answer">
		<ul>
			<li>First of all, show up for class, and be present and attentive. I talk about a lot of things in class that you won't find anywhere else. If you miss class, get the notes from a friend.</li>
			<li>Read the Discussion Board once a day. I post all sorts of vital information there, including homework tips and changes to due dates.</li>
			<li>Read your notes and text assignments before coming to class. And be sure to bring those notes and your textbook with you to class.</li>
			<li>Do the assignments. A no-brainer, right?</li>
			<li>Carefully follow all instructions to the letter. The syllabus contains very explicit instructions on things like submitting homework. I will be giving you further instructions throughout the course of the term. Follow them very carefully. You cannot imagine how frequently students lose points simply by not following instructions.</li>
			<li>Don't put things off until the last minute. This stuff is very challenging. Give yourself plenty of time to get things done.</li>
			<li>Ask for help. For many of you, this is the most difficult one on the list. Don't wait until you're in panic mode. Ask me for help. Ask your fellow students for help. Ask your baby brother for help. I'm here to answer your questions. If you're not understanding it, let me know. You can ask questions in class or meet with me during my office hours. I'm here to help you succeed. But don't wait until the last minute when I'm unable to help.</li>	
		</ul>	
	</div>
	
	<h2>So what made you decide to start teaching?</h2>
	<div class="answer">
		<p>I got tired of making all that money.</p>
